    <hr/>
    <p>
    Since this research centers around JavaScript, the programming language itself ought to be introduced first before the whole research can be discussed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5 class="tab-header">Javascript</h5>
    <p>
    JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages used to form the World Wide Web as we know it today. It is a <strong>“client-side” programming language</strong>, which means that the code is read, interpreted and executed in the client’s web browser. The role which JavaScript plays is essential as it enables the user to interact with web pages. Simply put, without JavaScript, most of the websites today would be stagnant and boring, and we would not be able to see the features that make our lives more convenient, such as interactive maps and animated graphics. Its popularity can be demonstrated by the fact that nowadays, around 94.9% of the websites use JavaScript, and it is also the most active language in both GitHub and StackOverflow.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5 class="tab-header">Objective</h5>
    <p>As now we have gained a general idea of what JavaScript does, it is time to inspect the overall objective of this research.</p>
    <p>When a piece of code is written, it is highly likely that there will be bugs, which may have unwanted and significant impacts on the functionality as well as the correctness of the programs. To help programmers eliminate as many bugs as possible, various tools have been created. For instance, a static code analysis tool, called Infer, was developed by Facebook in 2013, and it is used to find bugs for languages such as C, C++, Java and Objective C. With a tool like Infer, hundreds of bugs are identified every month before the code is finalized.  This saves the programmers a large amount of time finding and fixing bugs, which is a tremendous increase in productivity. </p>
    <p>JavaScript, despite its popularity and ubiquity, has not had a verification tool designed for it. This is mainly caused by its flexible features such as dynamic typing, which adds a lot of complexity to the construction of the verification program. In order to develop a similar verification tool like Infer for JavaScript programmers, a program called JaVerT (JavaScript Verification Toolchain) was conceived by Ms. Sampaio and her team. The goal of this research project is to investigate the effectiveness of JaVerT as well as the components and principles on which it is based.</p>

    <h2 class="tab-header">Separation Logic</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>Different types of logic are created over the past in order for us to reason about different things. For example, there are propositional logic, which is used to describe simple propositions; first-order logic, which extends propositional logic by adding variables and quantifiers . Separation logic, expectedly, was designed to deal with things which are not included in other types of logic. To be more specific, it enables us to reason about:
    </p>
    <p><ul>
    <li><strong>Shared and mutable data structures:</strong> structures where updatable fields can be referenced from more than one point.</li>
    <li><strong>Local reasoning:</strong> specifications and proofs for a program component refer only to the memory that component accesses.</li>
    <li>Recently, it was extended to incorporate <strong>concurrency</strong> and <strong>information hiding.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>With the use of separation logic, JaVerT is able to handle the dynamic and flexible features in JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tab-header">Symbolic Execution</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>In order to tell if a program is written correctly, different test cases are usually created. For instance, to see if a function outputs an integer smaller than 5 no matter what the input is, we can write the following:
    </p>
    <div class="container text-center">
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p class="mb-0"><em>assert(f(2) = 3)</em></p>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>
      However, as one notices here, it only tests for one possible situation, which is when the input of the function is 2. It does not cover all the cases described in the criterion, namely the output should be an integer less than 5. To generalize the testing, symbolic execution is used. For example, in this case, instead of tediously writing out test cases for all the inputs, we can just say:
      </p>
    <div class="container text-center">
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p class="mb-0"><em>int x;assert(f(x)&lt;5)</em></p>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>
    In this case, we replace the specific number in the input by unknown variables. Moreover, when an “if” statement (a type of statement that checks if a condition is met) is seen in the program, different paths can be generated for each condition in the statement. The overall result of the symbolic execution can be represented by a flow graph, an example of which is shown as follows:</p>
    <div class="container text-center">
      <img src="assets/symexe/flowgraph.png" class="img-fluid center-block" alt="Symbolic execution flow graph" width="343px" height=""/>
      <br><br>
      <p class="text-center"><em>Figure 1: Symbolic execution flow graph</em></p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
    Each path represents many actual test cases, and therefore, we are able to cover more situations so as to check the correctness of the program.</p>
    <p>The concept of symbolic execution is applied to many domains, such as verification, testing, debugging and optimization, and parts of JaVerT’s functionalities are realized with the help of this powerful concept.</p>

    <h2 class="tab-header">Bi-Abduction</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>Abductive inference is a concept from Philosophy and means finding the most likely explanation from an observation. Bi-abduction, simply put, allows the pre and post conditions to be generated from the bare source code . Here, pre-condition refers to the constraints or statements that must be satisfied before a program is called, and similarly, post-condition describes the statements that will be true after a program is executed. In short, bi-abduction provides JaVerT with the capability to see what the input and output of a piece of code should roughly look like.

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-jsil" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-jsil-tab">
    <h2 class="tab-header">JSIL</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>To reduce the impacts of the complex semantics of JavaScript, another indispensable component, JSIL, was introduced. JSIL is an intermediate language which can be translated into by the JavaScript source code. It is essential to the whole verification process as it is closer to the basic logic needed to test the correctness of the original program. In simple terms, it hides away all the needless semantics of the source code while preserving all of its logic and behavior. The image below demonstrates the steps in JaVerT’s verification process, if you are interested in the details, please check out this <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jfaustin/javert.pdf">research paper</a>.

    <h2 class="tab-header">Potential Impacts</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>Static code analysis is one of the most common methods to verify the correctness of a piece of code, and it is done by solely examining the code without actually running it. JaVerT, as you have probably expected, is a form of static analysis tool. As for now, it has two foreseeable positive impacts on our lives.</p><p>
  Firstly, as a verification tool, the debugging capability of JaVerT may save a huge amount of time potentially for the web developers. This, in turn, will increase the productivity and efficiency of many people working in this field and may lead to a growth of profit for the enterprise.</p><p>
  Well, if you are not involved in web development in any way, you might ask “how does this research affect my life?” The answer is simple. A verification program like JaVerT improves the overall quality of the code, and this will have a significant impact on the security and safety of the code as well. JavaScript is a web-based programming language, a bug in a program may cause serious cybersecurity issues. Imagine there is a bug in the JavaScript code that forms a website which you have visited, and this bug has induced a vulnerability in the webpage that will allow others to access your username and password. With the help of JaVerT, such problems can be avoided easily as the hidden bugs will be caught in the development process. To prove this point, the research team confirms that JaVerT has already detected bugs in real-world JavaScript code.

    <h2 class="tab-header">Future Goals</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>There are several goals which Ms. Sampaio and her team want to achieve in the future.</p><p>
Firstly, JaVerT can still be improved. Although JaVerT is a well-functioning program that is able to detect bugs in real-world JavaScript programs, it is still incomplete in several aspects. For instance, the compiler which translates JavaScript source code to JSIL does not cover all libraries in JavaScript. Therefore, the team’s next objective is to extend JaVerT’s scope of reasoning so that it covers more features of JavaScript.</p><p>
Secondly, to test the real capability of JaVerT, the team decides to analyze more complex libraries such as JQuery and React. Along the way, they will also need to tackle challenges such as dealing with the DOM API as well as modeling the behavior of events. If these tasks are completed, JaVerT will be one step closer to becoming a complete and polished commercial product.</p><p>
Last but not least, JaVerT can be viewed as the cornerstone towards other verification tools for dynamic languages such as PHP and Python. During Jose Fragoso Santos’s presentation about JaVerT in the Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, he was asked whether the team had thought of expending the JaVerT system to other dynamic languages. The answer to that was a definite yes. In the future, we will certainly see the emergence of verification tools designed for other dynamic languages. Speaking from that perspective, JaVerT is undoubtedly the milestone on the long road toward more advanced tools for static code analysis.
